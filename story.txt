The story is about a nurse. It starts in a mansion in a small town. The story begins with an inheritance and ends with a kidnapping.


Once upon a time,

There was a nurse named Barbara.  She came from a rich family. She moved to a very small and quiet city. She wanted to start a new life over there. Her rich family did not support her career choice of becoming a nurse.  They questioned why she would want to work at all when she already had everything paid for her. Her father made millions in the early 90's by inventing Toaster Strudel.
When the knock came, amid the whirring of the November wind, Barbara couldn't have been surpised. Maybe inconvenienced. She stopped while descending the narrow stairs to peer down upon the man at the door. He was carrying a brown paper parcel.
He threw the parcel at Barbara.  Barbara, being a former All-American wide-receiver at Penn State, snagged the parcel one-handed. When she looked up, the mysterious man was gone. She opened the parcel. she was shocked when she opened the parcel as she found a photo of her in a beautiful frame with a note said thank you for saving my life.
And they all lived happily ever after.
