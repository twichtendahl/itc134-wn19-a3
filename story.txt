The story is about a nurse. It starts in a mansion in a small town. The story begins with an inheritance and ends with a kidnapping.


Once upon a time,

There was a nurse named Barbara.  She came from a rich family. she moved to a very small and quite city. she wanted to start a new life over there. Her rich family did not support her career choice of becoming a nurse.  They questioned why she would want to work at all when she already had everything paid for her. Her father made millions in the early 90's by inventing Toaster Strudel.

And they all lived happily ever after.
