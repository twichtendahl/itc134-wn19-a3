The story is about a nurse. It starts in a mansion in a small town. The story begins with an inheritance and ends with a kidnapping.


Once upon a time,

There was a nurse named Barbara.  She came from a rich family. She moved to a very small and quiet city. She wanted to start a new life over there. Her rich family did not support her career choice of becoming a nurse.  They questioned why she would want to work at all when she already had everything paid for her. Her father made millions in the early 90's by inventing Toaster Strudel.

When the knock came, amid the whirring of the November wind, Barbara couldn't have been surpised. Maybe inconvenienced. She stopped while descending the narrow stairs to peer down upon the man at the door. He was carrying a brown paper parcel.

He threw the parcel at Barbara.  Barbara, being a former All-American wide-receiver at Penn State, snagged the parcel one-handed. When she looked up, the mysterious man was gone. She opened the parcel. She was shocked when she opened the parcel as she found a photo of her in a beautiful frame with a note that said thank you for saving my life.

The handwriting on the note did not match that of any she recognized; small black lettering of mostly capitals with the occasional lowercase letter thrown in had a slight masculine air to it though in Barbara's mind, it could go either way. 

The picture of herself in the lovely frame was another thing she did not recognize either.  In the picture, she estimated her age to be 14 or 15, she was out in front of her parents' Hampton home they used to own in the late 1980's, standing with two other kids her own age, a boy and a girl on either side, but for the life of her, neither of their faces looked familiar at all.  Who were these other kids and why doesn't she remember them or this picture?

The wind had died down; she lingered in the doorframe. Yellow light cloaked her shoulders as she looked at the image in her hands; behind her, the light illuminated in particular a stack of worn nursing textbooks on the vestibule floor and a gym bag sloughed along the opposite wall. Modest wicker and upholstered furnishings, themselves host to sets of keys, uniforms, coffee mugs, and documents, seemed pensive inhabitants of such a grandiose space. Subtle creases formed above Barbara's brow as the chill from outside seeped into her home. She closed the door, but stood motionless for one moment longer. No amount of rumination would suffice to answer the questions posed by the miracle. After making efficient travel preparations, she stepped out into the night.

Barb, as her friends call her, went to the train station, boarded a train, and finally arrived at her Hampton mansion/cabin/13th home around midnight on October 8th.  Waiting for her in the doorway were two people.

Before she could introduce herself, Barb found herself in the smothering embrace of her Aunt Maureen. "Barbara!" exclaimed the small yet energetic lady, prolonging Barb's forced apprehension, "Reginald and I were just going out to see the moon - How *are* you??! - What ever brings you to our neck o' the woods?" Barbara guardedly reciprocated the hug, and really believed that Maureen was surprised to see her. A kind smile showed on Reginald's gaunt face as he extended his hand to her. The trio went back inside holding hands in a way that was spontaneous but seemed to each of them farcical, and so they all began to laugh.

Barbara's main memory of Maureen, her father's sister, comprised the events connected to her parents' divorce. Although her steely presence beside her brother at home and in court had offended Barbara as a teenager, she had since come to understand the urgency of Maureen's position then. And Maureen, for her part, had made done her best to make amends, sending greeting cards and gifts at Christmas and each birthday and pictures of her foreign travels.

And they all lived happily ever after.
